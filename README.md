# part2

- *If we just run the original code with 'make', it only outputs a closing bracket '}'

Comments of actual code:
- Doesn't take an input (yet?); only testing on own "lines of codes" (variables)
- main.cpp could use a run of this code on it (isn't indented properly)
- **Need to label variables better to be more organized (string empty was supposedly the output in removeLeadingSpaces)**
- Definitely need to streamline the concepts first before trying to implement, as there were issues throughout/at the end which stemmed from small implementation decisions in beginning
